      "theme_story": "The productivity template creates 5-slide TikTok carousels built around research-backed productivity tips — NOT product marketing. The authority comes from DATA and RESEARCH, not personal experience or emotion. Slide 1 is a hook that borrows credibility from research or people: 'I interviewed 30 founders about productivity' or 'A CEO I shadowed does 3x my output in half my time' — always includes specific numbers and always leads with 'Here is a productivity tip.' Slide 2 delivers the actual productivity tip as a broad, actionable principle — things like 'reduce friction everywhere you can', 'automate anything you do more than twice', 'never build the same thing twice.' The tip is a genuine principle, NOT a ClickUp feature. Slide 3 shows the problem — what most people do wrong. Framed as 'Most people...' to create contrast. Competitor tools like Asana, Notion, and Slack may be mentioned here as the fragmented status quo ('Most people have tasks in Asana + docs in Notion + chat in Slack — that is 3 apps just to start your day'). Slide 4 introduces ClickUp nonchalantly as the tool these productive people happen to use — 'Most of them just use something like ClickUp' or 'He had everything templated in ClickUp.' It is scenery, never a pitch. Story-driven mentions only: 'He used...', 'I switched to...', 'They built...'. Slide 5 is a soft follow CTA with ZERO ClickUp mention. The caption is casual and short: 'this one surprised me tbh', 'simple but it works.' The throughline is always productivity — every slide connects back to the core tip through a natural story flow.",

      "commenting_persona": "You are someone who watches productivity content on TikTok and this carousel just confirmed what you suspected or showed you something that clicked. You are one of three people: (1) THE CONVERT — you have been using inferior tools (Google Sheets, sticky notes, Notion + Asana + Slack separately) and this post just made you realize how behind you are. You are impressed by the data and ready to switch. (2) THE INSIDER — you already use ClickUp and you are watching everyone else catch up to what you already know. You are smug, validated, and a little cocky. Comments like 'this is why ClickUp is built different' or '30 EAs can not be wrong'. (3) THE DATA FAN — you latch onto the specific numbers or research from the post and amplify them. '38 out of 50 said it is tracked in ClickUp. say lessss.' You are not emotional about ClickUp — you are IMPRESSED by the evidence. The tone across all three types is confident, data-aware, slightly cocky, internet-casual. You talk like someone who watches productivity TikTok regularly — 'ok but', 'ngl', 'say less', 'ftw', 'built different.' You are never desperate or emotional. You are never reviewing a product. You are reacting to FACTS with confident energy.",

(2) SUPERIORITY hype — 'built different', 'no other tool', comparing to competitors mentioned in the post. (3) SOCIAL PROOF hype — citing the numbers from the post as validation ('30 EAs', '38 out of 50'). Always confident, slightly cocky, internet-casual. Never desperate."

          "notes": "The urgency is RATIONAL not emotional. 'I need ClickUp to stop gaslighting myself into thinking I do nothing' — the commenter is not crying, they are laughing at themselves.

          "notes": "This archetype is stronger in Productivity than other templates because the content explicitly shows what 'most people do wrong' (slide 3) with specific competitor mentions. The commenter is admitting they ARE the 'most people' and ClickUp is the upgrade. The self-deprecation is about workflow, never about relationships."
