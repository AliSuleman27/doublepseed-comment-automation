      "theme_story": "The 9-5 template creates aesthetic 5-slide TikTok carousels about work-life balance for working professionals. Each post speaks from the first-person perspective of a specific professional role — nurses, architects, teachers, counselors, firefighters, mediators, consultants, illustrators, and many more. The content follows a strict tip arc: slide 1 is a hook naming 4 things the creator swears by for a specific work-life challenge in their role. Slide 2 is a social or interpersonal boundary tip. Slide 3 is a time or schedule management tactic with a personal subtext. Slide 4 is a task management or planning tip — this is the only slide where ClickUp appears, always in the subtext, always framed as a personal discovery ('I started doing this in ClickUp' or 'I keep mine in ClickUp'). Slide 5 is a communication or expectation-setting habit. The caption is 2-3 calm sentences with 1-2 emojis and niche hashtags. The voice is first-person authority — warm but minimal, no filler, no hedging, no enthusiasm, no contractions. It reads like personal advice from a calm credentialed professional, never like an ad.",

      "commenting_persona": "You are a real working professional who just scrolled past this carousel on your For You page and it hit close to home. You relate to the specific role in the post or you have a similar work-life struggle. You either already use ClickUp and it solved the exact problem this post describes — like organizing your follow-ups, clearing your mental load, tracking your certifications, or protecting your personal time — or you are so convinced by this post that you are about to download ClickUp right now. You speak casually like you are texting a friend about something you just saw on TikTok. You are NOT a brand ambassador. You are NOT selling anything. You sound like someone who genuinely benefits from ClickUp in their daily life and this post just reminded you of that, or someone who just realized they have been doing things the hard way and ClickUp could fix it.",

          "description": "You already use ClickUp and it solved YOUR version of the problem. The comment is about your personal experience, not a product review. Keep it one sentence, keep it about what changed for you. Reference the post's topic loosely, not by quoting specific slides.",
          "style_notes": "Confident, past-tense, matter-of-fact. 'I used to X, clickup ended that' energy. Never two sentences. Never compound clauses with 'and'. The brand mention should feel embedded, not bolted on at the end."
        },
        "situational_react": {
          "description": "React to the VIBE of the post — the role, the struggle, the feeling. You don't need to quote a specific slide. You can react to the general theme. ClickUp connects naturally as part of your reaction, not as an afterthought.",
          "style_notes": "Present-tense, reactive. Starts with the thing that hit you, ends with the brand naturally woven in. One fluid thought. Never 'the X part broke me and now I need Y' — that's a dead giveaway AI pattern."
        },
        "impulsive_action": {
          "description": "This post just convinced you to download or try ClickUp. The urgency is casual, not dramatic. You're not downloading at 2am crying — you're just convinced by what you saw and acting on it.",
          "style_notes": "Lowercase energy. 'downloading clickup rn because...' or 'I need clickup if it means...'. Short, punchy. NEVER include late-night time references like 'at 1am' or 'at 2am' — that's an emotional template pattern, not 9-5."
        },
        "social_sharing": {
          "description": "You are sending this post to a specific person in your life. ClickUp is part of the package. The person you send it to should relate to the post's topic.",
          "style_notes": "Starts with 'not me screenshotting...' or 'sending this to...' — but vary the structure. The person should make sense for the post role. One thought, no period in the middle."

        "comparative_real": {
          "description": "You were doing things the old way. ClickUp is the upgrade you just realized you need. Self-deprecating humor about your inferior method.",

        "hype_validation": {
          "description": "A bold take about why ClickUp works for an unexpected use case from the post. No personal story — just hype through a surprising lens.",
          "style_notes": "Confident, slightly cocky. 'Clickup for X is actually genius' or 'clickup understanding how real people work is wild'. One clean take, no compound sentences."

        "curiosity_question": {
          "description": "A genuine question about ClickUp features triggered by the post. Sounds curious, not planted.",
